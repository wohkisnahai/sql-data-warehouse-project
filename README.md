# ðŸ“Š Data Warehouse Project

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project involves building a modern data warehouse using the **Medallion Architecture** â€” consisting of Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers â€” to support end-to-end data analytics. Key components include:

- **Data Architecture**: Designing a robust data flow using layered data processing.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from raw ERP and CRM sources.
- **Data Modeling**: Creating fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Generating SQL-based reports and dashboards for insights.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Develop a scalable, maintainable data warehouse on **SQL Server** to consolidate sales and customer data for analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.

---

## ðŸ›  Specifications

- **Data Sources**: Two source systems â€” ERP and CRM â€” provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Data cleansing, standardization, and deduplication applied.
- **Integration**: Merge datasets into a single star schema optimized for querying.
- **Scope**: Focus on current/latest snapshot data only (no historization).
- **Documentation**: All structures and transformations are well documented for both business and technical stakeholders.
